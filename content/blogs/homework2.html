<h1>Climate change and temperature anomalies</h1>
<p>If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the <em>Combined
Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies</em> in the
Northern Hemisphere at <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp">NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space
Studies</a>. The <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt">tabular data of
temperature anomalies can be found
here</a></p>
<p>To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base,
period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between
1951-1980.</p>
<p>Run the code below to load the file:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>weather &lt;- 
  read_csv(&quot;https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv&quot;, 
           skip = 1, 
           na = &quot;***&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: <code>skip</code> and
<code>na</code>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <code>skip=1</code> option is there as the real data table only starts in
Row 2, so we need to skip one row.</li>
<li><code>na = "***"</code> option informs R how missing observations in the
spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see
that missing data is coded as “***”. It is best to specify this
here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric
data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled <code>weather</code>
in the <code>Environment</code> panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the
top-right), go to <code>Tools</code> &gt; <code>Global Options</code> &gt; <code>Pane Layout</code> and tick
the checkbox next to <code>Environment</code>. Click on the <code>weather</code> object, and
the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.</p>
<p>For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of
temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide
format.</p>
<p>You have two objectives in this section:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Select the year and the twelve month variables from the <code>weather</code>
dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this
assignment. Hint: use <code>select()</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p>Convert the dataframe from wide to ‘long’ format. Hint: use
<code>gather()</code> or <code>pivot_longer()</code> function. Name the new dataframe as
<code>tidyweather</code>, name the variable containing the name of the month as
<code>month</code>, and the temperature deviation values as <code>delta</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>year,</li>
<li>month, and</li>
<li>delta, or temperature deviation.</li>
</ol>
<div id="plotting-information" class="section level2">
<h2>Plotting Information</h2>
<p>Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a
trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called
<code>date</code> in order to ensure that the <code>delta</code> values are plot
chronologically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following chunk of code, I used the <code>eval=FALSE</code> argument,
which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the
document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe
<code>tidyweather</code>. When you actually want to run this code and knit your
document, you must delete <code>eval=FALSE</code>, <strong>not just here but in all
chunks were <code>eval=FALSE</code> appears.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="r"><code>tidyweather &lt;- tidyweather %&gt;%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, &quot;1&quot;)),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color=&quot;red&quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = &quot;Weather Anomalies&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<p>Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months?
Use <code>facet_wrap()</code> to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month,
again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels;
that is, each month should be labeled “Jan”, “Feb”, “Mar” (full or
abbreviated month names are fine), not <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to
study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as
1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes
a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980.
The code below creates a new data frame called <code>comparison</code> that groups
data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010
and 2011-present.</p>
<p>We remove data before 1800 and before using <code>filter</code>. Then, we use the
<code>mutate</code> function to create a new variable <code>interval</code> which contains
information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign
the different periods using <code>case_when()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>comparison &lt;- tidyweather %&gt;% 
  filter(Year&gt;= 1881) %&gt;%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable &#39;interval&#39;, and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ &quot;1881-1920&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ &quot;1921-1950&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ &quot;1951-1980&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ &quot;1981-2010&quot;,
    TRUE ~ &quot;2011-present&quot;
  ))</code></pre>
<p>Inspect the <code>comparison</code> dataframe by clicking on it in the
<code>Environment</code> pane.</p>
<p>Now that we have the <code>interval</code> variable, we can create a density plot
to study the distribution of monthly deviations (<code>delta</code>), grouped by
the different time periods we are interested in. Set <code>fill</code> to
<code>interval</code> to group and colour the data by different time periods.</p>
<p>So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might
be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using
<code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarise()</code>, followed by a scatter plot to display
the result.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly &lt;- tidyweather %&gt;% 
  group_by(Year) %&gt;%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(......) 

#plotting the data:


  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method

  
  #change theme to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="confidence-interval-for-delta" class="section level2">
<h2>Confidence Interval for <code>delta</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php">NASA points out on their
website</a>
that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast
amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that
much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge
the Earth into the Little Ice Age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual
delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation
with the <code>infer</code> package. Recall that the dataframe <code>comparison</code> has
already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we
are only interested in what is happening between 2011-present.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>formula_ci &lt;- comparison %&gt;% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

#print out formula_CI

<p>The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of
weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks
14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).</p>
<p><img src="../../images/tfl_weekly.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of
rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each
week/month of 2020-2022 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the
calculation <code>excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals</code>.</p>
<p>Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected
rentals? Why?</p>

<p>This is a very rich data set, not just for energy and CO2 data, but for many other technologies. In our case, we just need to produce a couple of graphs– at this stage, the emphasis is on data manipulation, rather than making the graphs gorgeous.</p>
<p>First, produce a graph with the countries with the highest and lowest % contribution of renewables in energy production. This is made up of <code>elec_hydro</code>, <code>elec_solar</code>, <code>elec_wind</code>, and <code>elec_renew_other</code>. You may want to use the <em>patchwork</em> package to assemble the two charts next to each other.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/renewables.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Second, you can produce an animation to explore the relationship between CO2 per capita emissions and the deployment of renewables. As the % of energy generated by renewables goes up, do CO2 per capita emissions seem to go down?</p>
<p><img src="../../images/animation.gif" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>To create this animation is actually straight-forward. You manipulate your date, and the create the graph in the normal ggplot way. the only <code>gganimate</code> layers you need to add to your graphs are</p>
<pre><code>  labs(title = &#39;Year: {frame_time}&#39;, 
       x = &#39;% renewables&#39;, 
       y = &#39;CO2 per cap&#39;) +
